Welcome to Day 7!
(yesterday I had an issue and the number of the day was repeated, so you'll see two different Day 5 emails)
Yesterday, we covered translating [[stakeholder business]] requirements into a [[mathematical model]]. You took the spoken word and transformed it into elegant summations, inequalities, and tiny italicized variables.
But like approaching the first hill on a rollercoaster: You know things are about to get wild.
Today, you’re going to take a beat. You’re going to use this day to formulate something else: a fresh mindset…a DecisionOps mindset.

What you’ll find: You feel more in control of the process, more confident in the outcomes, and more collaborative with your stakeholders. So, buckle up, hold on, and keep your eyes open.

##Focus on the how, not just the what

In 2019, we heard 87% of data science projects never make it into production. In 2025, we heard 95% of AI projects fail. There’s a lot to unpack in these narratives, but one thing is clear: Success is not solely defined by what you build, but by how you build it.
You can design the most perfect decision algorithm, but if stakeholders can’t trust it, if it’s last in a never-ending engineering queue, if it isn’t testable, if runs aren’t repeatable, if it’s hard to monitor and manage, then it’s doomed to death by a thousand paper cuts.

- “My metrics don’t match yours. What input did you use?”
- “Can you email me your run logs?”
- “I think I overwrote my results again…experiment-5-final-final(1).json was it?”
- “Do you have time to expose these new solver options for testing?”
- “Well, it worked on my machine.”

Sound familiar? Why is it that algorithms designed to deliver fantastic efficiency are so inefficiently developed and operationalized?
DecisionOps: This is the way
ABC Financial has entrusted you with improving their business operations and returns. Your newly formulated mathematical model will not go quietly into the night. That’s because you’re resolved to adopt and apply DecisionOps.

## What is DecisionOps?
[[DecisionOps]] is a set of practices, tools, and infrastructure for [[operationalizing decision models]] quickly, consistently, and reliably. The practices are collaborative across [[stakeholders]]. The tools support model testing, monitoring, and version management. The infrastructure unlocks deployment, scaling, and orchestration.

This can manifest in several ways:
- The ability to cloning past runs to reproduce and troubleshoot issues
- Turnkey scenario testing for “what if” exploration
- Shadow mode for surfacing alternative plans under similar conditions
- A system for managing and referencing model versions and configuration
- Approachable UI for visualization and interaction across stakeholders
- A common API layer for interacting with all of your decision apps
Ultimately, DecisionOps is the speed and trust layer on top of your optimization work.
What [[DevOps]] did for software development and [[MLOps]] for machine learning models, DecisionOps is doing for decision intelligence.

Build more [[decision models]], not more decision tools
Pioneers in deploying decision models alongside real-time cloud software like DoorDash and Stitch Fix invested early in building and maintaining tools to build and maintain decision models. In most cases, these types of in-house initiatives require significant investments in up-front and recurring costs. But it’s not 2015 anymore.

In the same way you use GitHub for developing code or Google Docs for writing reports in order to avoid sorting through and reconciling attachments, changes, and updates in email threads 60+ replies long, you can pick up a ready-to-go DecisionOps solution to streamline your decision model lifecycle. The solution you’ll be using for The Advent of OR is Nextmv.

If you don’t have a nice beverage or snack on hand, now’s the time to get one before you settle into a comfortable spot for a few moments to have a think on today’s task.

One way to view DecisionOps is through the following lenses:
[[Observability]]. Knowing who did what, when, and with what I/O.
[[Experimentation]]. Pressure testing models to reduce rollout risk and build confidence.
[[Orchestration]]. Scaling existing and new use cases quickly with workflows that connect to your stack.
[[Collaboration]]. Getting decision model value into the hands of stakeholders faster.

Ask yourself, in your past experiences:
Which area did you experience the most challenges in?
What made that challenging? Access to resources? Leadership buy-in?
Which area would have provided the most immediate value to your previous projects?
