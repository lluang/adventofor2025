After that first meeting with stakeholders, you'll often walk away with a mix of complaints, wishes, constraints, and historical context.

Your job is to extract the signal from the noise.

The key is to identify the **five building blocks** of any optimization problem hiding in what they told you:

Every business problem that can be optimized has these components, whether stakeholders describe them explicitly or not:

1. **[[Decisions]]**: What actions can be taken? What levers can be pulled? These become your _[[decision variables]]_.
2. **[[Objectives]]**: What does "better" mean? Is it lower cost, higher profit, less risk, faster turnaround? This becomes your _[[objective function]]_.
3. **[[Constraints]]**: What limits exist? Budgets, capacities, regulations, policies? These become your _constraints_.
4. **[[Data]]**: What information exists to quantify the decisions, objectives, and constraints? This determines what's actually solvable.
5. **[[Sets]]/Structure**: What are the entities involved? Products, customers, time periods, locations? These become your _sets and indices_.

The stakeholders won't hand you these neatly labeled. They'll say things like "we can't exceed our risk limits" (constraint), "we want to maximize returns" (objective), or "we could sell some loans or originate new ones" (decisions).

Your job is to listen for these building blocks and start mentally organizing what you hear.

  

###  **![🎯](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/16.0/1f3af/72.png) The gap analysis mindset**

Remember from Day 1: a [[well-framed problem]] is a **measurable gap** between [[current state]] and [[desired state]].

Today we sharpen that into:

**Current State → [Decisions] → Desired State**

subject to

**[Constraints]**

measured by

**[Objective]**

This simple structure helps you validate whether you truly understand the problem. If you can't fill in all the boxes, you have more questions to ask.
