This repository documents my efforts in the Advent of OR 2025 https://adventofor.com/ run by Borja Menendez https://bmenendez.github.io/

Focuses on any coding or model implementation parts of Advent of OR.  I am using R/OMPR for model implementation.
The context for this project includes @OR_Using_R by Tim Anderson, and the INFORMS Analytics Framework.

I'm using Gemini Code Assist (Gemini CLI) for the model, informed by the references above.  And yes, I have to be vigilant about accepting changes, then edit before I'm done. but it is a good to learn how well it works outside a live (real customer) project.

Note that in parallel I am answering the questions being posed on the Borja's LinkedIn page (I'm writing those) and using generative AI to answer non-coding questions. I'm using NotebookLM.google for that (with additional textbooks as sources for the GenAI context.
