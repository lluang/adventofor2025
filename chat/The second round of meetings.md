{pare%}:[[Advent of OR]]
(a.k.a. what happens after the first meeting… every time)

In the real world, the problem described in the first meeting is rarely the real problem. As you present your initial understanding, [[stakeholders]] get excited and start asking for more.

Your job is to show that your foundational approach is robust enough to handle these new requirements.

So you presented your initial understanding of ABC Financial’s portfolio rebalancing challenge and something interesting happened:

“Your presentation was insightful. It made us reflect on the art of the possible. We have other ad-hoc processes, can your approach handle those too?”

They are unsure whether your proposed approach would be able to handle them, but as a curious professional, you ask what this new information looks like.

They explain that each asset/loan type is managed by a different business team. They set guidelines on the amount by which the exposure in their asset can grow or shrink quarter over quarter.

🧪 THE PRACTICE
Responding to ABC Financial
The new information from ABC Financial introduces one critical element that pushes the boundaries of our initial formulation:

Multiple stakeholders/assets: Different business teams managing different asset/loan types with specific, local constraints (growth/shrink limits).
This is the first time you’ll show leadership. Not with equations, but with clarity.

Your job is to demonstrate that your approach is flexible enough to accommodate all new requirements.



📐 The extensibility test
When new [[requirements]] appear, run them through this mental checklist:

Does this change the [[decisions]]? New actions to take, or just refinements of existing ones?
Does this change the [[objective]]? A new goal, or an additional consideration within the same goal?
Does this change the [[constraints]]? New rules, or variations of existing limits?
Does this change the [[data requirements]]? New inputs, or just more granular versions of what we have?
Does this change the structure? New entities, or subdivisions of existing sets?
If the new requirements fit into the same five building blocks, your approach can handle them. You're adding complexity, not changing direction.

If they require new building blocks entirely, you might be looking at a different problem.



🎯 The response
When stakeholders ask "can your approach handle X?", the answer is rarely a flat yes or no.

The professional response is: "Here's what we'd need to get it..."

This does three things:

Confirms your approach is flexible ([[building trust]])
Identifies the data/information gaps ([[setting expectations]])
Moves the conversation forward (keeping momentum)
Never promise before you understand.

But never dismiss before you explore.
