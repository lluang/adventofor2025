Part of [[Advent of OR]]
[[INFORMS Analytics Framework]]
 

[[Spotting opportunity]] is just the beginning. The real skill is [[framing]] it properly.

Let's put this into practice.

Imagine you've been pulled onto a new project with [[stakeholders]] from the credit risk management department at ABC Financial. You know nothing about their specific problems yet.

_(BTW, this is the context we're going to have during the whole Advent)_

Because you are an experienced analytics professional, you know exactly what information you need from that first meeting to properly frame the [[business problem]].

Here are some essential questions:

**[[Understanding the problem]]:**

- What problem are they trying to solve?
- Why do they think this is a problem?
- What business processes contribute to the problem?

**[[Quantifying the impact]]:**

- What related business metrics are tracked for this problem?
- What is the current value of the metric indicating there's a problem?
- What is the target value that would indicate success?

**[[Mapping the landscape]]:**

- What information are you currently using in the processes that contribute to the problem?
- What do you believe is the relationship between the things you can control and the problem you're stating?

See the pattern? These aren't OR questions, they're _business_ questions.

**T****hey accomplish something crucial**: they move you from "we have a problem" to "we have a measurable gap between current state and desired state, with identified levers we can pull".

And they protect you from the #1 failure mode:

👉 **[[building the wrong thing]], beautifully.**
