In December 2025 I participated in the Advent of OR (https://adventofor.com) which was a 24 day exercise that guided participants through an optimization project. And instead of just solving problems and creating models, the Advent of OR walked through an entire project life cycle, using the INFORMS Analytics Framework.

While I am not a student or early career who was the target audience, I took part, and I had three goals.

1. Use a new programming toolkit. I used VS Code with R and Quarto.  I usually use R Studio and I wanted to try R on VS Code.  And I think Quarto is the future replacing Jupyter Notebooks for Python and a natural evolution from R Markdown.
2. Practice in optimization. In the Operations Research world,  I am NOT an optimization person. My thesis was applied probability (queuing) and my methods research has been in simulation (one stream in ranking & selection and another stream in Bayesian methods for input modeling)
3. Using Generative AI. I wanted to see how generative AI does in an operations research project.  And I wanted to do it right in a setting where I can give it references to guide it.  Note: I have found that Generative AI favors descriptive statistics, machine learning, and hypothesis based statistics over other forms of analytics, so it needs some guidance.

## Toolkit

I had to set up VS Code with the R extensions, Quarto (and extension), ompr and the glpk with associated R ROI packages, and to make sure everything worked, I download the respository for OR_using_R by Tim Anderson.  Then to render the book (meaning I made sure all the code ran) I had to install texlive with xetex and extra fonts.  Generative AI (I had Gemini CLI installed) was very helpful in all of the system administration tasks since it could figure out what was needed every time there was an error message.
